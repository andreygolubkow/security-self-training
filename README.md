## It's your way to defence your apps
In this repo I'm going to make exploiting vulnerabilities exercises, it will describes how the attacker can broke your app. 
It will be simple and you can use it **only for learning** how to defence your web-application. 
You should not use it for real apps which belong to someone!

So, the author of this bundle will not be responsible for other usage cases and I can't promise you that you will learn all security nuances.
